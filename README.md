<h2>Description:</h2>
Canada has an increasing proportion of the older population which are beyond the age of working and therefore also prefer to take things in a more chill way choosing to opt for comfort rather than mobility, this project does just that where we are able to connect young individuals dedicated to helping their community to elders who are looking for help with services such as shoveling their sidewalks or other menial tasks in exchange for volunteer hours as well as CareAge points which can be used to redeem different prizes in the real world.
The way to run this program can be broken down in five steps. This project was our team's submission to HackCanada 2025 where the objective was to develop something to solve a Canadian issue.
<h2>How to Run:</h2>
<ul>
<li>1. Install an IDE, preferably Visual Studio Code</li>
<li>2. Install the latest version of Python that is available off of python.org</li>
<li>3. Go to command line and enter in "pip install -r requirements.txt"</li>
<li>4. Once all the packages are installed, you are set to run the command "flask run"</li>
<li>5. Then navigate to the respective port as shown in the command and voila</li>
</ul>
